## Bitnami - Gitlab

Those files are the story of an experience with a bitnami/gitlab instance on EC2.

Regarding those links, it looks like a trap (I confirm !):

https://community.bitnami.com/t/upgrade-documentation-lacking-clarity/45226/6
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40254733/updating-bitnami-gitlab-documentation-lacking-clarity

With those files you will be able to find a way to properly:

1. Upgrade Gitlab
2. Upgrade Go
3. Upgrade Ruby
4. Leave this bitnami instance to a gitlab.com bucket or an installation with omnibus packages.
